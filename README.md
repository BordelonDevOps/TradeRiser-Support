TradeRiser.AI is an investment education and research platform designed for self-directed traders who want more than hype, guesswork, or blind speculation. The goal is to bridge the gap between professional-grade research tools and everyday market participants, giving individuals access to resources that have traditionally been locked behind paywalls or institutional walls.

Why It Exists
The idea for TradeRiser.AI started in an unlikely place Wallstreetbets discord where quick gains, “YOLO” option calls, and screenshot-driven bragging rights dominate the conversation. A few months ago, I had the audacity to ask a few serious questions about strategy and data, the response was dismissive, with comments ranging from “You fail” to the now infamous, “Your mom should swallow these puts.”

That moment made something clear. There was no neutral, accessible space where regular people could ask intelligent trading questions without being drowned out by noise. TradeRiser.AI was built to change that. The platform’s mission is to democratize financial education so that individuals, regardless of starting capital or prior experience, can make informed decisions backed by research and data, not just momentum-driven chatter.

What It Does
TradeRiser.AI provides educational resources covering market structure, asset classes, risk management, and fundamental analysis. It offers analytical tools for studying stocks, ETFs, crypto, and alternative assets. It also delivers research dashboards that pull structured financial data into one place for deeper exploration.

The emphasis is on learning first, trading second, empowering users to understand the “why” behind every potential move.

What it Doesnt do.
TradeRiser doesnt give you Investment Advice, nor does TradeRiser.AI does not provide personalized investment recommendations. All tools and data are for educational and research purposes only. Before making any financial decisions, consult a qualified financial adviser or certified planner.
Data is sourced from multiple providers and is updated regularly, but absolute accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Independent verification is encouraged. I strongly urge you to consider a financial rep with a fiduciary role. 

Support and Next Steps
A user support wiki is in development and will be launched after community feedback from early users. This will serve as a central hub for platform usage guides, research tutorials, frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting tips. I tried to make this as intuiative as possible. 

For now, if you have questions, use the Issues section of this repository. If you encounter a bug, document it clearly and I will respond as soon as possible.


If you like what you see then please by all means click https://shorturl.at/4vwxO to donate and help me keep the server running. Right now its about $175 a month with all the usage.

Thank you for all of your patronage and help. I hope you learn as much about stocks as I have.
